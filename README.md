 # Local Contexts Integration

## Description
The Local Contexts Integration module enhances your Drupal site by incorporating the Local Contexts initiative, which offers digital strategies for Indigenous communities, institutions, and researchers through Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and Notices. This module facilitates the integration of these labels and notices into your Drupal content, promoting the recognition and proper use of Indigenous cultural heritage.

## Features
- **Integration of TK Labels**: Easily add and manage Traditional Knowledge Labels within your Drupal content types.
- **Automated Display**: Labels and Notices are automatically displayed on relevant content, ensuring consistent acknowledgment of Indigenous rights and interests.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the module, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
```bash
# Required software dependencies
PHP >= 7.4
Drupal >= 9.x
Composer >= 2.x
```

## Installation
Installation instructions will be provided based on the method Eric chooses to make the module available.

## Usage
1. **Specify the Field for Project ID**:
   - You must create your own field or specify an existing field that will store the **Project ID**.
   - The module reads the **Project ID** from this designated field and retrieves the appropriate Local Contexts Labels.

2. **Automatic Display**:
   - The system automatically fetches and displays the relevant labels based on the stored **Project ID**.

## Example Use Cases
- **Digitized Indigenous Knowledge Collections**: Museums and archives can use this module to embed Local Contexts Labels on digital records, ensuring proper attribution and cultural protocols are maintained.
- **Integration with Islandora Repositories**: Libraries using Islandora can automate the inclusion of TK Labels on digital assets.
